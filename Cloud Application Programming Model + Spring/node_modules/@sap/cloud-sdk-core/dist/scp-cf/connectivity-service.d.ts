 * Given a destination and a JWT (required for subscriber destinations), this function will add a proxy configuration to a destination.

 * This function will reject if no connectivity service is bound, no XSUAA service with plan application is bound or the client credentials grant with the XSUAA service fails.
 *
 * @Deprecated In version 1.16.0 web proxy support was added so this method was renamed to addProxyConfigurationOnPrem to better distinguish the to cases.
 *
 * @param {Destination} destination The destination to which the proxy configuration should be added.
 * @param {string} jwt The JWT of the current user.
 * @returns {Promise<Destination>} A promise resolving to the destiation with the added proxy configuration.
